## Hi üëã My name is James Wright
=============================

Trained Data Profesional looking to start a career in data!
------------------------------------------------------------

I graduated from the University of Bath with a 2:1 in MPhys Physics with Astrophysics. This is where I became very accomplished at programming in both Python and C. Since graduating, I completed a training programme at Sigma Labs where I learnt software fundamentals, networking, backend, cloud, data fundamentals followed by completing multiple advanced data projects - including building live data pipelines, migrating data and deploying dashboards. Some of my projects I have completed are linked below!
to achieve my career goals of working in data.

* üåç¬† I'm based near London, UK
* ‚úâÔ∏è¬† You can contact me at [james.wright2@bath.edu](mailto:james.wright2@bath.edu)
* üß†¬† I've been trained on using AWS, Terraform, Docker, Python & SQL

### Projects

You can read about my Master's Project, which involved analysing simulation data to validate a contested Physics theory, [here.](https://github.com/james-plw/james-plw/blob/main/Physics%20Master's%20Project)

Since graduating, I have also completed a personal project, analysing some data from the 23/24 Premier League season, to practice using PYthon, SQL and Tableau. You can find that [here.](https://github.com/james-plw/james-plw/tree/main/Football%20Data%20Analysis%20Project)

During my training at Sigma Labs, I created a full pipeline to connect museum ratings data from a Kafka topic to a Postgres database on RDS. This can be found [here.](https://github.com/james-plw/museum-advanced-data-project)

Another project completed during this training involved data migration from an RDS to an S3 bucket to save costs for a food truck company. This can be fround [here](https://github.com/james-plw/trucks-advanced-data-project).

I was also part of a group project that obtained live data on plants from an API, transformed and loaded it into RDS for short-term storage, before moving it to an S3 bucket for long-term storage, before creating a live dashboard for the museum staff. The project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/mercuridi/Coursework-W13-LMNH).

I finished my Sigma Labs training in advanced data, with a 2 week group project that involved building a data pipeline that tracks new releases on major PC platforms, helping game discovery and building an understanding of what is currently being released. An online dashboard and subscriber system involving daily notificatons and daily reports was also created. The project repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JKTapper/Week-14-Game-Tracker-Project).
