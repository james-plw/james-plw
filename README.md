## Hi 👋 My name is James Wright
=============================

Physics Graduate looking to start a career in data!
------------------------------------------------------------

I graduated from the University of Bath with a 2:1 in MPhys Physics with Astrophysics. This is where I became very accomplished at programming in both Python and C. Since graduating, I have completed online courses to further improve my Python skills, and to learn SQL, to achieve my career goals of working in data.

* 🌍  I'm based near London, UK
* ✉️  You can contact me at [james.wright2@bath.edu](mailto:james.wright2@bath.edu)
* 🧠  I've recently learnt and practiced using SQL and Tableau

### Projects

You can read about my Master's Project, which involved analysing simulation data to validate a contested Physics theory, [here.](https://github.com/james-plw/james-plw/blob/main/Physics%20Master's%20Project)

Since graduating, I have also completed a personal project, analysing some data from the 23/24 Premier League season, to practice using PYthon, SQL and Tableau. You can find that [here.](https://github.com/james-plw/james-plw/tree/main/Football%20Data%20Analysis%20Project)

During my training at Sigma Labs, I created a full pipeline to connect museum ratings data from a Kafka topic to a Postgres database on RDS. This can be found [here.](https://github.com/james-plw/museum-advanced-data-project)
